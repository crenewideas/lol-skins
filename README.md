## Overview

The League of Legends Skins Repository is a centralized, carefully maintained collection of in-game skins for League of Legends in formats compatible with custom skin applications. Generated using [ritoskin](https://github.com/nylish/ritoskin), this repository provides players with access to a wide variety of champion skins.

Custom skins are purely cosmetic and only visible to the player using them, offering no competitive advantage in gameplay. This project addresses the accessibility gap created by Riot Games' pricing model, which has made certain content unattainable for many players, especially following the introduction of Vanguard anti-cheat which rendered previous tools like LolSkin or R3nzSkin unusable.

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter any issues with skins (crashes, visual bugs, etc.), please submit an issue to this repository. With the large number of skins available, we rely on community feedback to identify and fix problems.

---

## Philosophy

We believe that gaming culture should be inclusive and accessible, not just a privilege for those who can afford it. The introduction of premium skins with prohibitive pricing (such as exclusive skins costing the equivalent of multiple months' wages in some regions) has created a significant barrier for many players.

> We hold that gaming culture should be inclusive and accessible, not just a privilege for those who can afford it.

Our repository aims to democratize the visual aspects of League of Legends without affecting gameplay balance or competitive integrity. While we offer all skins freely through this repository, maintaining this service requires resources and dedicated effort from our team.

Exalted uses the same skins as this repository, therefore, you can get it only to help the developers. 

**It is the primary source of funding that allows us to maintain the free lol-skins repository.**

By offering Exalted as a reward for those who support our project, we can continue our mission of making gaming culture more accessible to everyone. Your donation helps fund ongoing development, server costs, and regular updates to keep all skins freely available in the repository.

## Using lol-skins

### Prerequisites

- [x] League of Legends client installed
- [x] A custom skin injection tool compatible with .zip format skins

### Installation Steps

1. **Choose a Custom Skin Injection Tool:**
   ```bash
   # You can use any tool that allows custom skin injection
   # Check our Discord server for recommended options
   ```

2. **Download Skins:**
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Individual download
   # Browse the repository and download specific skin .zip files
   
   # Method 2: Clone entire repository (recommended)
   git clone https://github.com/darkseal-org/lol-skins.git
   ```

3. **Import Skins to Your Injection Tool:**

   <details>
   <summary>Typical Import Process</summary>
   
   - Most skin injection tools allow drag-and-drop functionality
   - Import the downloaded skin zip files into your chosen tool
   - Activate the skins through the tool's interface
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Manual Import Method</summary>
   
   - If drag and drop doesn't work, many tools have an "installed" folder
   - Copy the skin files directly into that folder
   - Check the tool's documentation for specific instructions
   </details>

4. **Launch Game:**
   ```bash
   # Start League of Legends
   # Your selected skins will be active in-game
   ```

### Best Practices

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always download the latest version of skins after game patches. Outdated skins may appear white, have missing textures, or cause game crashes.

- Keep your skins organized by champion
- Use GitHub Desktop to easily sync and update your local repository
- Run skin management tools as administrator for proper permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>White or Bugged Skins</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Skins appear all white or have visual bugs

**Solutions**:
1. Re-download the latest version of the skin from the repository
   ```bash
   # Delete the old skin file from your injection tool first
   # Download the updated skin file
   # Re-import the new version
   ```
2. Verify you're using the version compatible with the current patch
3. Check if the issue is already reported on GitHub
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Missing Health Bars or Audio</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Health bars are missing or there's no sound/voicelines

</details>

<details>
